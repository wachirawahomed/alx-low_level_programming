# Search Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various search algorithms in C programming language. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate C file and is thoroughly documented.

## Description

This project aims to provide efficient implementations of various search algorithms. Each algorithm is designed to find a target value within a collection of data.

## Implemented Algorithms

The following search algorithms are implemented in this repository:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Jump Search
- Interpolation Search
- Exponential Search
- Advanced Binary Search
- Jump Search in a Singly Linked List
- Linear Search in a Skip List
